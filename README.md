Homework for Module 2 - VBA

# This is my VBA homeowrk for Module #2
# All deliverables for this are withing the "Submission" folder 
# Everything should run correctly with the exception of the Calculated values for Greatest % Increase and Greatest % decrease. I've reviewed this with both Xpert and ChatGPT  and been unable to return a successful submission. Reviewing it against the professors example I've also been unable to pinpoint the difference in the code that is causing mine to be incorrect. Any feedback on this would be greatly appricitaed. 
# code is saved as both a VBA script file and TXT file
